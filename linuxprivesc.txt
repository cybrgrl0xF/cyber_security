Linux Privilege Escalation Checklist
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Tools
LinPeas
Comprehensive enumeration script for Linux systems.
Command: linpeas.sh
Description: Scans for misconfigurations, vulnerabilities, and potential privilege escalation paths.
GTFOBins
A collection of Unix binaries that can be exploited to get root privileges.
Command: find / -type f -perm -04000 -ls 2>/dev/null
Description: Lists files with SUID or SGID bits set, which can be cross-referenced with GTFOBins for known exploitable binaries.
Sudo
Command: sudo -l
Description: Lists the commands a user can run with sudo privileges. Misconfigurations can be exploited to gain root access.
Cron Jobs
Command: crontab -l
Description: Lists cron jobs running with elevated privileges. Misconfigured cron jobs can be exploited to gain root access.
Unshadow
Command: unshadow passwd.txt shadow.txt > passwords.txt
Description: Combines /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow files for password cracking with tools like John the Ripper.
2. Methods
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUID/SGID Exploitation
Identify SUID/SGID binaries using find / -type f -perm -04000 -ls 2>/dev/null.
Cross-reference with GTFOBins to find exploitable binaries.
Sudo Misconfigurations
Use sudo -l to list allowed sudo commands.
Exploit commands that can be run without a password or with insufficient restrictions.
Cron Job Exploitation
Identify cron jobs running with elevated privileges using crontab -l.
Modify or replace scripts executed by cron jobs to gain root access.
Writable Configuration Files
Check for writable configuration files (e.g., /etc/passwd, /etc/shadow).
Modify these files to add new users or change permissions.
Kernel Exploits
Identify and exploit known kernel vulnerabilities (e.g., Dirty Pipe, PwnKit).
Use tools like Exploit Database to find relevant exploits.
Environment Variable Manipulation
Exploit environment variables like PATH to run malicious binaries with elevated privileges.
3. Common Vulnerabilities
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUID/SGID Binaries
Misconfigured SUID/SGID binaries can allow attackers to execute commands with elevated privileges.
Sudo Misconfigurations
Overly permissive sudo rights can be exploited to run commands as root.
Cron Job Misconfigurations
Cron jobs that execute user-editable scripts can be manipulated to gain root access.
Writable Configuration Files
Writable /etc/passwd or /etc/shadow files can be modified to grant elevated privileges.
Kernel Vulnerabilities
Known kernel vulnerabilities can be exploited to gain root access.
